# Chirpspace-Tweets
A clean and concise webapp specifically made to help Twitter content creators get into a flow-state while writing tweets and threads. Built using React and deployed with Vercel.

# About
Chirpspace was inspired during my first foray into creating content for Twitter, when I noticed how easy it is to get distracted away from writing your own content by unintentionally reading other content on the platform. 

I realized that there were other tools available online that could be used for similar purposes as Chirpspace, but I wanted to create something that was streamlined for one exact purpose and that didn't suffer from unnecesssary feature bloat. 

Additionally, I wanted to challenge myself to build something entirely on my own from conceptualization to initial shipment, all using React. 

# Challenges Overcome & Lessons Learned
-Getting used to React, its features, and how to properly use and render compenents
-Implementing Dark Mode & Light Mode UI settings 
-Developing a method that allows users to "save" their written content and then download it as needed in plaintext format
-Creating quick keystrokes so users can easily add/remove textboxes without needing to shift their hands away from the keyboard

# Current Known Issues
-The downloaded plaintext files do not distinguish threads from tweets, and can seem ambigious when compiled together
-The middle "save/rest" button only works via mouseclick
-The site is designed for mobile usage

# Future Potential Enhancements
-Increasing "no distractions" via gamification where the user is "locked" into full-screen mode and cannot exit until they've either completed a writing related challenge or type out a specific phrase
-Further gamification where the user attempts to beat their previous "high score" for how many tweets they can write within a given time frame 
-Adding mobile site
